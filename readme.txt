from tutorial:
    Letâ€™s build a LIVE NEWS APP with Next.js 13 (TypeScript, StepZen, Tailwind, Dark Mode, GraphQL)

    by Sonny Sangha

local start:
    npm run dev

deployed:
    https://live-news-nextjs13-stepzen.vercel.app

    In this deployed version, the 'Read More' button doesn't 
    work properly, so I used 'Link' to send the user directly 
    to the article.

update:
    git add .
    git commit -m 'message'
    git push

a clone of another person's build was put here:
    C:/dev/live-news

nextjs 13 is still in beta and seems a little buggy

mediastack's free tier quota for the month is quickly used up, 
see .env.local
